# SpeakSprechen
A game written in python to help you practice foreign language pronunciation

To get started just run main.py
I have an english mode and a german mode, if you want to add more languages you need to create to files.
Say you are creating a Spanish mode, first you need a create a text file called es.txt in the WordLists folder and add words to it.
Second you need to translate the UI by copying the en.txt file in the translations folder. Rename the copy es.txt and translate it to Spanish.

Now when you run main.py you should have an es language selection.
